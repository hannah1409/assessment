WHY DRUPAL 8 WAS CHOSEN

Assessment site is made in Drupal 8.5.3. Drupal 8 was chosen because it has object oriented approach, core multilingual modules, improved website loading speed, allows fast theming,  mobile friendly, and supposedly has longer life cycle than Drupal 7.

------------------------------

STRATEGIC AND ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS

Front page consists of Courses View with Topic Area, Difficulty Level, and Price Range filters exposed to visitors. This is achieved using Views and Better Exposed Filters modules.

Multilingual functionality is made with core modules. Admin interface will remain in English, because Translation source is set to Local files only.

Wishlist functionality is built using Flag module. Wishlist tab is located in My account. The "People" View, allows authenticated users to see Wishlists from other users. 

Content type "Course" consists of the following field types: text, number (decimal), file, entity reference, link, image, video embed.

Content creator can choose focal point of an image. This was achieved with the help of Focal point module.

In the bottom of each Course page there are links to Add this course to wishlist and Take this course. 

Link to MOOC system Sign up can be added by edditing "Take this course" block. 

The website can be themed using Twig.

---------------------------------

HOW TO TEST FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

1. The user can view the courses site in 3 languages by changing language in Language switcher or changing language prefix in URL.

2. Focal point of a course image can be moved in Course Edit page.

3. Wishlist functionality can be tested by adding and removing courses to wishlist and viewing other users wishlists in People menu item.

The site can be also tested at http://anna.cyclity.com/
